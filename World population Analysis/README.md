## Case study #4: Analysis of World Population
In this project, I've analyzed the world's population data from a dataset retrieved from Kaggle. The dataset comprises information on world population data from different countries over the period of 1970 to 2022.

### Case Study Questions
1. What are the highest and lowest population sizes in the year 2022?
2. What countries have a total population that is greater than the average population in 2020?
3. What countries were the most densely populated in 2022?
