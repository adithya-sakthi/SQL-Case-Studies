### Case study: Credit card spending habits in India
I recently came across a case study on the Kaggle website.
          
Here is the link to download the credit card transactions [dataset](https://lnkd.in/dBkkCw2n)          
             
I used various SQL functions such as :                               
* Case When Statements           
* CTE            
* Joins         
* Logical Operator              
* Group by, Order by, Where         
* Aggregate functions Sum, Count                
* Date functions datepart,Datename, Datediff               
* Window functions(DENSE_RANK, LAG)
